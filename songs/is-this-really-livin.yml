name: Is This Really Livin'?
lyrics: |
  Spare a thought
  Spare some consideration for the famous
  They've been stretched, drawn, diluted, spread out on the glass
  For our entertainment
  They gambol in our souls, for an hour or two
  Before fading
  And where can they go then?

  Oh we take, we take, we take until they've nothing left to give
  And they fake, and they fake it, and they fake, oh, this is really living

  Like you, they had a name once,
  They had a name to which they'd come when called, but we've named them
    something else
  They had their secrets and their shames, their private dreams and unspeakable
    regrets
  But we have taken them away
  To catch our grease and line our nests and train our pets and stuff our shoes
    with their dreams turned black upon white
  And what have we left them?

  Oh we take, we take, we take until they've nothing left to give
  And they fake, and they fake it, and they fake, oh, this is really living
