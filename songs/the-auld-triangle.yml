name: The Auld Triangle
lyrics: |
  A hungry feeling came o'er me stealing 
  And the mice were squealing in my prison cell 
  And that auld triangle went jingle-jangle 
  All along the banks of the royal canal 

  To begin the morning the screw was bawling 
  "get up, ya bowsey, and clean out your cell!" 
  And that auld triangle went jingle-jangle 
  All along the banks of the royal canal 

  Oh! the lags were sleeping, hampy Gussy was peeping
  And I lay weeping for my girl Sal
  And that auld triangle went jingle-jangle 
  All along the banks of the royal canal 

  On a fine spring evening the loike lay dreaming 
  And the sea-gulls were wheeling high above the wall 
  And that auld triangle went jingle-jangle 
  All along the banks of the royal canal 

  Oh! the wind was sighing and the day was dying 
  As the loike lay crying in his prison cell 
  And that auld triangle went jingle-bloody-jangle 
  All along the banks of the royal canal 

  In the women's prison there are seventy women 
  And among them I wish I did dwell
  Then that auld triangle could go jingle-jangle 
  All along the banks of the royal canal
  All along the banks of the royal canal
