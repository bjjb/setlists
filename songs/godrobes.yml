  Hold on to your friends
  They're only as tenable as your temper
  Hold on to your friends,
  and when they disappoint you, forgive them.

  Forgive them their trends, their fashions, their fads,
  And lo! as they flock to the ember, absolve them.
  Hold on to your friends
  And when they let you down, you just pick yourself up with a shining smile
    to confuse, and beatify

  Then you, you've attained happiness
  You, you've attained happiness
  Yeah, yeah, you're clothed in happiness...

  Let love be your guide
  Dog those meandering tricks never-ending
  Let love be your guide
  And demolish all obstacles keeping you from love
  And never decide
  Just dust yourself off, let your halo illuminate
    the dusty clouds of your sanctifying

  Then you, you've attained happiness
  You, you've attained happiness
  Yeah, yeah, you're clothed in the robes of the gods.
