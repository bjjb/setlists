name: Control
lyrics: |
  The stage is set, the actors are holding their breaths
  for the entrance stage left of their Julius Cesar
  Who's dodging the spotlight and biting his nails
  And training his voice not to shake when he sees her
  come in, pin him down with her critical eyes
  That are grey when she smiles
  Or laughs, or puts on a mask of a confidant, confident in her control

  Oh, maybe she's dead inside, maybe she's comatose, maybe she's sleeping
  Maybe she's dead inside
  Oh, maybe she's dead inside, maybe she's comatose, maybe she's sleeping
  Maybe she's dead inside

  Tell me your name
  Oh, tell me anything, I'm ready to hear it, this time
  Tell me your name
  And I'll write it in letter of fire a thousand foot high
  on the lawn of the house where our children are sleeping
  Oh, tell me your name

  Oh, maybe she's dead inside, maybe she's comatose, maybe she's sleeping
  Maybe she's dead inside
  Oh, maybe she's dead inside, maybe she's comatose, maybe she's sleeping
  Maybe she's dead inside

  You curse me in the night, you curse me in the night, you curse me
    but at least you're thinking of me
  You curse me in the night, you curse me in your sleep, you curse me
    but at least you're thinking of me
