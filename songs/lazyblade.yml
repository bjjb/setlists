lyrics: |
  Who's to say that it's all over?
  Who's to say you won't come crawling back with bruises on your arms?
  I must admit, I was surprised to see you leave
  Swallowed by my rueful smile of disbelief
  In this disco we should have known
  That in this disco there's no room for standing still

  I saw lazy blades around me
  Red and grey lazy blades around me
  they never live that long, my pets never live that long
  With you, my cure in their side
  I saw lazy blades around

  Give a sigh as you expire
  Gasp, moan as you leave Babylon for Serendipity
  A crimson arc of mercy splatters the plastic shrouds, as your sweetness spreads
  To be the daisies growing in a dump somewhere in anon

  Through is all I was a slave
  I bleed a tear for every bloody tear in every hidden limb

  I saw lazy blades around me
  Red and grey lazy blades around me
  they never live that long, my pets never live that long
  With you, my cure in their side
  I saw lazy blades around
