name: I'll Tell Me Ma
lyrics: |
  I'll tell me ma when I go home the boys won't leave the girls alone
  They pulled my hair they stole my comb but that's alright 'til I go home
  She is handsome she is pretty, she is the belle of Belfast city
  She is courting one, two, three, pray would you tell me who is she

  Albert Mooney says he loves her, all the boys are fighting for her
  They knock at the door and they ring at the bell saying "oh, my true love are you well"
  Out she comes as white as snow, with rings on her fingers and bells on her toes
  Ol' Jenny Murray says she'll die If she doesn't get the fellow with the roving eye

  I'll tell me ma when I go home the boys won't leave the girls alone
  They pulled my hair They stole my comb But that's alright 'til I go home
  She is handsome she is pretty she is the belle of Belfast city
  She is courting one, two, three pray would you tell me who is she

  Let the wind and the rain and the breeze blow high and the snow come falling from the sky
  She's as sweet as apple pie she'll get her own lad by and by
  When she gets a lot of her own she won't tell her ma when she gets home
  Let them all say as they will, for Albert Mooney she loves still

  I'll tell me ma when I get home the boys won't leave the girls alone
  They pulled my hair they broke my comb but that's alright 'til I get home
  She is handsome she is pretty she is the belle of Belfast city
  She is courting one, two, three pray would you tell me who is she

  Albert mooney says he loves her all the boys are fighting for her
  They knock at the door and they ring at the bell saying "oh, my true love are you well"
  Out she comes as white as snow with rings on her fingers and bells on her toes
  Ol' Jenny Murray says she'll die if she doesn't get the fellow with the roving eye

  I'll tell me ma when I go home the boys won't leave the girls alone
  They pulled my hair they stole my comb but that's alright til I go home
  She is handsome she is pretty she is the belle of Belfast city
  She is courting one, two, three, oh please won't you tell me who is she
