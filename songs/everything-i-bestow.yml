  Well, you may not see me when you come back. 
  I could be sharin' someone else's pillow. 
  And my love for you is better than diamonds, 
  To you, ev'rything, I bestow. 
  And tomorrow I'll be dancing on my own, 
  And I'll need a kiss for my head that's achin'. 
  And I'll be a hungry dog without a bone, 
  hoping my place with you's not taken. 

  Kiss me and tell me it's not broken. 
  Kiss me and kiss me till I die. 
  See, I'll give you the stars from the bruised ev 'nin' sky 
  and a crown of jewels for your head, now, 
  for your head, now, for your head, now, for your head 
  One last night in bed for a time, 
  and two more wishes. and both are for thine. 
  And three guesses you're the angel's child, 
  and four hopes this love's not spoiled 

  Kiss me and tell me it's not broken. 
  Kiss me and kiss me till I die. 
  See, I'll give you the stars from the bruised ev 'nin' sky 
  and a crown of jewels for your head, now, 
  for your head, now, for your head, now, for your head now 
  If you come back, I'll take you to the garden, 
  we'll dance to an orchestra on the lawn. 
  And we'll roll in the foggy dew 
  and dance with the ghosts upon the dawn., on the dawn, on the dawn 

  (Then you'll) Kiss me and tell me it's not broken. 
  Kiss me and kiss me till I die. 
  See, I'll give you the stars from the bruised ev 'nin' sky 
  and a crown of jewels for your head, now, 
  for your head, now, for your head, now, for your head now 
  for your head, now, oh oh
