name: Give Him Silver
lyrics: |
  I am happy.
  Pondering. Making every difference to make everybody happy.
  I itch.
  It's a bit too internal to reach.
  I scratch it. But it's someone else's enema.

  Caught him by the tail and swung him round and round and round and then said
    "ouch", as if it hurt me.
  Caught him by the tail and swung him round and round and round and then said
    "ouch", as if it hurt me.
  Call a vet to stop the bleeding!
  Call a vet to stop the bleeding! Give him silver!
  Call a vet to stop the bleeding! Give him bronze!

  Stones are mainstream
  Doing what they possibly can do to roll up everybody selfless
  Rolled in the amnesty of shallowness
  I guess it labels me a neater Judas

  Caught him by the tail and swung him round and round and round and then said
    "ouch", as if it hurt me.
  Caught him by the tail and swung him round and round and round and then said
    "ouch", as if it hurt me.
  Call a vet to stop the bleeding!
  Call a vet to stop the bleeding! Give him silver!
  Call a vet to stop the bleeding! Give him bronze!
