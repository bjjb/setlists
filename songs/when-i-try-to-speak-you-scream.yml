name: When I Try To Speak You Scream
lyrics:
  So! You're more delicate than I am
  And many times wealthier
  And while we're thinking of words that rhyme with pretty
  I'll whisper them over again
  Into your head like a dream you're trying to forget
  As we're looking at sun and remembering clouds in the morning
  in the afternoon

  Oh, do we belong with the bees and the trees here in Merrion Square?
  And are we in love?
  Or are we just walking around?

  You give me a flower you found on the ground and I think about smiling
  then do
  and we're laughing at leopard's' confinement, benignly,
  the only free predators prowling the zoo
  Tell me this
  Is there a price on our handing our S's to the satisfied
  And a grin plastered on faces of children?
  When no one says L-O-V-E anymore?

  Oh, do we belong with the bees and the trees here in Merrion Square?
  And are we in love?
  Or are we just trampling the grass?

  I have something in my mouth
  Something that you need to hear
  It would sort everything out
  But when I try to speak you scream.
