name: She Moved thro' the Fair
lyrics: |
  My young love said to me, my mother won't mind 
  And my father won't slight you for your lack of kine, 
  And she stepped away from me and this she did say, 
  It will not be long love 'til our wedding day. 

  She stepped away from me and she moved through the fair, 
  And fondly I watched her move here and move there, 
  Then she went her way homeward with one star awake, 
  As the swan in the evening moves over the lake. 

  The people were saying no two were e'er wed, 
  But one has a sorrow that never was said, 
  And I smiled as she passed with her goods and her gear, 
  And that was the last that I saw of my dear. 

  I dreamt it last night that my young love came in, 
  So softly she entered her feet made no din, 
  She came close beside me and this she did say, 
  It will not be long love 'til our wedding day.
