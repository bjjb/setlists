name: Turn Me Back
lyrics:
  I am the neverleave saying goodbye to you
  I am the holdyouup laying you down
  Sorry to leave you there standing with companygone
  Sorry I stayed with you up until now

  I'll find a way to make it easier to be free
  Find a way finally to turn me back
  And I find it so hard to believe that I never meant
  All the world to you, I'm easy to please

  You were the shimmering flash that I had to have
  You were the adoring eyes that I gouged
  Never again will my headlielow mindholdstill
  Never again will I stumble around

  I'll find a way to make it easier to be free
  Find a way finally to turn me back
  And I find it so hard to believe that I never meant
  All the world to you, I'm easy to please

  (I'll find it...)

  Happy I maybe when it suits us to be us
  Happier I'd be if it suited me
  Talk about loyalty, not singularities
  Guess I am dirt you're not rooted to me

  I'll find a way to make it easier to be free
  Find a way finally to turn me back
  And I find it so hard to believe that I never meant
  All the world to you, I'm easy to please
