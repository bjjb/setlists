name: 28
lyrics:
  When I first saw you I was standing here on my own
  Standing alone
  When I saw you you were surrounded by menageries of pussy-cats
    swinging their tails to the sound of your voice

  And all of these stories that we wrap around us like cloaks,
  shimmer and glow
  And absorb fascination, ephemeral interest that shines like a star
    about to explode, then sputters and whimpers

  I should have never pretended to care
  I will know better next time
  Honestly, honesty hasn't a prayer
  I will know better next time

  You shouldn't have swum in the pools of the hope in my eyes
  You probably drowned
  And got massaged back to life as a willing young wife
  A willing young half of a just half of a life

  I should have never pretended to care
  I will know better next time
  Honestly, honesty hasn't a prayer
  I will know better next time

  Each time I see you, I barely believe there was ever a thing
  Ever a thing in our lives better than what we don't have anymore

  When I first saw you I was standing here on my own
  Standing alone
  When I saw you you were surrounded by menageries of pussy-cats
    swinging their tails to the sound of your voice
