lyrics: |
  Your eyes are amythests and your skin is pearl
  I take a look and I'm locked up
  Your eyes are amethysts and your hair's woven gold
  I steal a look and am locked up

  And as we face the night together, how to make you stay?
  I will build a cage to keep you from the greedy clutches of the day
  I'll keep you safe

  Your smile is gravity and your eyes are stars
  I'm a moon collapsing in your space-time
  Your smile is gravity and your eyes are neutron stars
  I'm a moon collapsing to a singularity

  And as we brave the night together will fortune keep you mine
  I will light a torch and wave it in the faces of the messengers of dawn
  I'll keep you safe, that's all I know
  I'll keep you safe, that's all I know
