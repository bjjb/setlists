name: Plans.Retribution
lyrics: |
  Sold my soul, sold my brain, sold my wisdom for asylum from the pain
  Does it make me lobster? Does it make me hermit crab?ยง
  Does it make me animal? Anemone? Pretty till you feel it grab
  Oh no! Where is our rescue? Where is your saviour when it's your enemy?
  Oh no! Where is your comforter? Did it break upon your mother's knee

  Pull you up, pull me down, and when you're laughing, are we laughing, are we
  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha-artful tricks
  or antics for the punters
  or the haze on recollection that some of us call lies?
  Oh no! Where is our rescue? Where is your saviour when it's your enemy?
  Oh no! Where is your comforter? Did it break upon your mother's knee

  We are the plans for retribution
  Oblivious to our dilution
  And when you feel our trident wrath
  Will anybody notice?
  Will anybody care?

  Gasp for air, gasp for life, gasp at pleasure when it cuts you like a knife
  You'll call it treason, I'll call it treachery
  We'll call it theft and plunder, rape and murder, old satanic lechery
  Oh no! Where is our rescue? Where is your saviour when it's your enemy?
  Oh no! Where is your comforter? Did it break upon your mother's knee
  
  We are the plans for retribution
  Oblivious to our dilution
  And when you feel our trident wrath
  Will anybody notice?
  Will anybody care?
