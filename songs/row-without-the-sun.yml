name: Row Without the Sun
lyrics: |
  If I were a season, which one would I be?
  Autumn and winter are best left to experts like a mythical me
  For example, I schemed for a thousand millenia
  Just to hurl my own lightning bolts down upon Thor
  But I had to stay in, cause it started to rain
  There's a storm in my circle

  And I'll row without the sun
  row without the sun
  row without the sun burning holes in my back (in my back)
  without the sun burning holes in my back

  Let's play a game, let's stand on the ocean and see who will live for the longer
  I won't complain, I won't cough, I won't splutter
  As loud-spoken sympathies fill up my lungs, because
  being alone is blissful,
  and bliss just reminds me of pain
  All on a boat in a sea won't you sing with me
  Or will you just listen?

  As I row without the sun
  row without the sun
  row without the sun burning holes in my back (in my back)
  without the sun burning holes in my back
