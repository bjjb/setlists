title: Salt & Nicotine
lyrics: |
  Set to sail with a pocket full of diamonds
  Till I was cast adrift on a barrel of rope

  You can tell my mother, if you see my mother
  Her son is breathing

  I fled the disappointed eyes, and I hacked of my destiny
  But I know the rocks, and the rocks know me

  You can tell my mother, if you see my mother
  Her son is breathing still

  (Salt and nicotine)

  Set to sail with a pocket full of pebbles
  Till I was cast adrift on a barrel of stones

  You can tell my mother, if you see my mother
  Her son is breathing
  salt and nicotine
  He's breathing (breathing) salt and nicotine
