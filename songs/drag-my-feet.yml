name: Drag My Feet
lyrics: |
  Given the choice, I'd rather you were happy
  Your fungers are moist, I know you were alone this morning
  Hear my voice echoing through your world as it crumbles
  
  Summer comes and flits away and leaves a flora of decay
    which I gratefully collect so everybody knows it's mine
  Disenchanted, disillusioned, with a flare for self-abuse I
    drag my feet in the space you left behind
  
  Struggling like fish my words disperse in desert clouds
  A louder superstition now roars an empty promise
  I'm sorry now, as if I've never been sorry
  Hiding like a lie as your world falls
  Hiding like a lie as your world falls

  Summer comes and flits away and leaves a flora of decay
    which I gratefully collect so everybody knows it's mine
  Disenchanted, disillusioned, with a flare for self-abuse I
    drag my feet in the space you left behind
  Nothing ventured, nothing gained except the bones of what remained
    when the revellers had gone
  It's easy then to hide your pain amidst the flotsam
    and those jokes we cling to

  They are only words
  They are only words
