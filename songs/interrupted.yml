name: Interrupted
lyrics: |
  It's not your place to pull the stitches from the scar
  and to declare it's healed
  Those stubborn little platelets follow currents of their own
  And have their own ideas
  So let the body do
  as bodies will.
  Don't interfere
  You were picking the scab (picking the scab, picking the scab)
  Before you were interrupted.

  You say you'd rather be the owner than the dog
  And who would fain accede?
  That independence on the sheer dependency
  Is what a body needs
  So hold your role
  Don't devolve
  Keep your role
  You were chasing your tail (chasing your tail, chasing your tail)
  Before you were interrupted.
