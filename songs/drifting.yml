  Woah, now, everybody's talking of the red meat,
  Dead meat, skulls upon your bottles of verve
  I was fine before
  Never been a-swimmin' in the gulf of Aden,
  Never ate an animal that I didn't think I didn't deserve

  What's the harm in living life for free?

  When the weekend looks like it's just another Wednesday,
  What the harm in carryin' on like there's only until Friday to go
  I was fine before
  Never met a snake, never killed a baby,
  Never half remembered what I oughtn't have forgotten, no, no

  As we shake the trees of our memories and epiphanies rain down
  Remember!

  Never drilled for oil, never kissed a baby
  Never eat an apple that you aren't sure you don't deserve
  With their charts and stories they try to terrify us
  Try to tell us that the earth is going to get her own back soon
  I was fine before and I'll be fine again
  
  They tell me polar bears are drifting out into the sea
  well, better them than me
  They tell me polar bears are drifting out into the sea
  well, better them than me
  
  Keep those fucking bears away from me, let them drift into the sea
  Let them all drown
  Keep those big bad bears away from me, let them drift into the sea
  Let them all drown
