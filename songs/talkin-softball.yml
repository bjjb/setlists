name: Talkin' Softball
lyrics: |
  Well Mr. Burns had done it
  The power plant had won it
  With roger Clemens clucking all the while
  Mike Socia's tragic illness made us smile
  While Wade Boggs lay unconcious on the barroom tile
  We're talkin' softball, from Maine to San Diego
  Talkin' softball, Don Mannigly and Canseco
  Ken Griffey's grotesquely swollen jaw
  Steve Sax and his run in with the law
  We're talkin' Homer, Ozzie and the straw
