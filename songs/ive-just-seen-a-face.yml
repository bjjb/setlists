name: I've Just Seen A Face
composer: Lennon & McCartney
lyrics: |

  I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place Where we just met
  She's just the girl for me And want all the world to see We've met

  Had it been another day I might have looked the other way
  And I'd have never been aware But as it is I'll dream of her Tonight

  Falling, yes I am falling And she keeps calling Me back again

  I have never known The like of this, I've been alone And I have
  missed things And kept out of sight But other girls were never quite Like this

  Falling, yes I am falling And she keeps calling Me back again
  Falling, yes I am falling And she keeps calling Me back again

  I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place Where we just meet
  She's just the girl for me And want all the world to see We've met

  Falling, yes I am falling And she keeps calling Me back again
  Falling, yes I am falling And she keeps calling Me back again
  Oh, falling, yes I am falling And she keeps calling Me back again
