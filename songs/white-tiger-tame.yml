lyrics: |
  Hurry restless feet, don't leave me stranded
  In winter planted
  Suffer ye now to move
  And move you turgid tongue don't leave me open
  Torn wide open
  By ravenous facts from left

  "Take me home, take me home", she whispers at me
  "Take me home"
  And even though the night's been ugly she's still looking fine
  So we go home, we go home, conjoined, three-legged
  We go home
  And warning off the jealous shadows I make sure she's mine.

  Move you languid body paraplegic, as if to please
  the saturday night's demands
  Move you languid body paraplegic
  Just to appease, oh
  The night and the weekend are young

  "Take me home, take me home", she whispers at me
  "Take me home"
  And even though the night's been ugly she's still looking fine
  So we go home, we go home, conjoined, three-legged
  We go home
  And warning off the jealous shadows I make sure she's mine.
