name: Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye
lyrics: |
  When on the road to sweet Athy, hurroo hurroo
  When on the road to sweet Athy, hurroo hurroo
  When on the road to sweet Athy, a stick in the hand and a drop in the eye
  A doleful damsel I heard cry: "Johnny I hardly knew ye"

  Where are the eyes that looked so mild, hurroo hurroo
  Where are the eyes that looked so mild, hurroo hurroo
  Where are the eyes that looked so mild When my poor heart you first beguiled
  Why did ye run from me and the child, Johnny I hardly knew ye

  With their guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo hurroo
  With their guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo hurroo
  With their guns and drums and drums and guns the enemy nearly slew ye,
  Me darlin' dear, ye look so queer, Johnny I hardly knew ye

  Where are the legs with which you run, hurroo hurroo
  Where are the legs with which you run, hurroo hurroo
  Where are the legs with which you run, when first you went to shoulder the gun
  I think your dancin' days are done, Johnny I hardly knew ye

  You haven't an arm, you haven't a leg, hurroo hurroo
  You haven't an arm, you haven't a leg, hurroo hurroo
  You haven't an arm, you haven't a leg, you're a spinless, boneless, chickenless egg
  And you'll Have to be put with the bowl to beg, Johnny I hardly knew ye
