name: She Is The Music
lyrics:
  She could be the moon as I'm hanging out my window
  I never want to leave her gaze, want to be forever smoking
  She's the music of my favourite song behind me
  Makes me want to come inside, and be forever out of breath

  But either way, she's tearing me apart
  She is the music
  She is the moon, she is the music

  She could be the river as I walk by it without her
  Arguing my cases for me, doing fine alone
  She's the tedium of a day is isolation
  Working for my long-term good, doing as I should

  But either way, she's tearing me, she's tearing me apart
  She is the music
  She is the moon, she is the music
