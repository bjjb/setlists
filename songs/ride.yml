  What's happened to us?
  We used to be faithful and trusting and proud
  And a little bit of faith wasn't asking too much

  Monkey man you may be
  You'll never find me picking fleas of your back
  And there's no fleas on me
  
  Talk all you want at me
  I've got a secret I'll never stop talking about
  I'll yell it, I'll shout till I'm hoarse

  And you may take me for a fool
  But you won't take me for a ride

  Keep your philosophy
  Your heretic paleontology
  I've got my brontosaurus tibia circa BC 2009
  And that suits me fine

  See Jesus frequently speaks to me
  He does it through books and through priests and through mysteries
  I know where I'm going, I know where I'm going to end up

  So you may take me for a fool
  But you won't take me for a ride
